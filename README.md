# SE4050 â€“ Deep Learning  
## Lab 1: Introduction to Python Libraries for Deep Learning

### ðŸ“Œ Objective
The objective of this lab is to gain knowledge and practical skills in using Python libraries and frameworks that are essential for deep learning.  
The lab focuses on **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**.

### ðŸ“‚ Contents
This repository contains solutions for the following tasks:

#### **Task 1**
1. Create a random 4x4 array from an exponential distribution.
2. Create a random 100000x1 array from the same exponential distribution and visualize the histogram along with uniform and normal distributions.
3. Plot `Z = XÂ² + YÂ²` in a 3D plot with x and y limits set to [-5, 5].
4. Calculate Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients for given features and visualize them using heatmaps.

#### **Task 2**
1. Load `Au_nanoParticle_dataset.csv` into a DataFrame.
2. Create a new DataFrame containing only `N_total`, `N_bulk`, `N_surface`, and `R_avg` columns.
3. Display the first 20 samples.
4. Calculate mean, standard deviation, and quartile values for the selected features.
5. Plot histograms in a 1x4 layout.
6. Use Seaborn's `pairplot` and `PairGrid` to visualize scatter plots, histograms, and KDE plots.
